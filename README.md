# Orbs
Orbs is a 2D tile game written completely in Java. In the game, the player must help a scientist retrieve a set of multicolored orbs for his experiment. These orbs can be acquired in many different ways. Some will require the player to look through special trees to find them, others will require the player to run an errand for another character in the game, and some may just be lying on the ground for the player to pick up. To win the game, the player must find and return all of the orbs to the scientist so that he can complete his experiment.
