Hi, are you one of the volunteers that are supposed to help with the  radiation issue?
You are? Great! You'll need a hazmat suit to be able to walk into town safely, though.
I have one here, but unfortunately there is a hole in it...
I'll need to borrow a sewing kit to patch it up quickly, but I have no idea where to get one.
If you could do me a favor and get me a sewing kit, I can have your   hazmat suit ready in a couple of minutes.
Come back when you have one.
