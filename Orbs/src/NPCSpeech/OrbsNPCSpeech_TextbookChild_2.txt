Hey there!
I was just learning about the different planets in our solar system. The only problem is that my textbook is very outdated...
It still lists Pluto as a planet!
I wish I had enough money to pay for the most recent edition, but they’re just so expensive!
Wait a minute, you have one with you?
Wow! You sure are lucky! Would you mind if I borrow it for a while? I sure would love to see how much has changed since the last version was published.
I can have it? Thank you! And don’t worry, I’m a fast reader. Why don’t you come back later and I’ll return it to you?
Thanks again for the book!
