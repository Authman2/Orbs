Hey there!
I was just learning about the different planets in our solar system. The only problem is that my textbook is very outdated...
It still lists Pluto as a planet!
I wish I had enough money to pay for the most recent edition, but they’re just so expensive!
Wait a minute, you have one with you?
Wow! You sure are lucky! Would you mind if I borrow it? I sure would love to see how much has changed since the last version was published.
I can have it? Thank you so much!
Here, why don't you take this in return. I found it earlier this morning while I was working on an experiment outside.
It’s so shiny and colorful I thought you might like it!
You received a(n) Orb!
