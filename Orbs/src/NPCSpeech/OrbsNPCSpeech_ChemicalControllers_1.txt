Stop right there!
I cannot allow you to enter this town without proper equipment.
You see, there is some sort of strange object that is emitting what we think is radioactive material in the middle of town.
While we await more professional help, residents are being advised to stay inside of their homes and close all windows and doors.
I cannot let you through without a hazmat suit. I apologize for any   inconvenience this may cause.
