Ahh!
I cannot believe this!
All of my orbs! They've been stolen!
Oh no, this is very bad...
I could lose all of my funding for this!
I could even go to jail if they end up in the wrong hands!
Huh? What's that?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. I was too busy worrying about my    experiement...
Would you like to hear about it?
You would? Great! It's very interesting, if I do say so myself!
To put it simply, I have created 20 multi-colored orbs.
Each orb holds great power, and is capable of bending reality at will!
I planned on using them to cure diseases, end world hunger, etc...
Anything you could think of, these orbs could do it!
The only problem is that someone has stolen them out of my laboratory!
I cannot imagine what kind of person would do this...
I would go look for the culprit myself, but I am afraid he might come back and try to steal more inventions out of my lab.
Wait a minute!
You could go look for the criminal, couldn't you? It would surely help a lot.
What do you say?
You'll do it? Oh thank you very much! I really appreciate this!
Now, what you must do is look for all 20 of the orbs.
I have no idea where they might be, so make sure you look beneath     every rock, behind every tree, and right under your nose!
Also ask around! Other people might know where they are, too!
The point is to look everywhere. It is anyone's guess where these orbs may be!
Now go! Please bring back my most powerful inventions!
I will be waiting here when you return!
