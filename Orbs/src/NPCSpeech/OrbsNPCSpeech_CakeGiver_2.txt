Hello, welcome to my bakery!
The biohazard team said that we can’t leave the building until they find a way to get rid of the radioactive material in the middle of town.
Well, anyway, are you here to pick up an order?
You are? Great, let me just see your receipt.
You hand the man the Bakery Receipt.
Ok, I’ll have your cake in just a few minutes.

Here you go!
