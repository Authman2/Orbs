Excuse me, but would you be able to do me a favor?
See you, I would like to grab some textbooks for my students to use, but since we are not allowed to leave the building they cannot start on their homework.
Would you be able to pick up the textbooks from the bookstore just north of here?
I placed the order a while ago hoping that they would be able to deliver them, but I guess not.
So will you do it?
You will? Thank you very much! Here, you will need this.
You received a(n) Bookstore Receipt!
