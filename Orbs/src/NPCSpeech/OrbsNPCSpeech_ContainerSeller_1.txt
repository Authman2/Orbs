Hi there! I sell all sorts of jars and containers.
Would you like to hear about our item of the day? It is a small, square box used to store potentially dangerous materials.
Nothing will slip out of this container! It can handle anything you put into it, and it's perfect for any type of storage!
If you're interested, I can sell it to you for $40.
You'll take it? Great! Here you go!
Thank you for shopping with us!
