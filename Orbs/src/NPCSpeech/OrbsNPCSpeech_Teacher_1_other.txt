Excuse me, but would you be able to do me a favor?
See you, I ordered a brand new set of textbooks for my students and need to pick them up before the end of the day.
I cannot leave my students alone, so would you be able to pick up the textbooks from the bookstore just north of here?
I placed the order a while ago hoping that they would be able to deliver them, but I guess not.
So will you do it?
You will? Thank you very much! Now the children will still be able to get their homework done!
