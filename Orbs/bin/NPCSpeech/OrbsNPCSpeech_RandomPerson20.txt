Oh, you're planning a vacation to the Bahamas?
That's so cool! Have fun and bring me back a souvenir!
What? Oh, sorry, I was talking to one of my friends over the phone.
He's a retired mine worker and lives in the next town over.
If you ever need mining equipment you should talk to him. He said he's looking to get rid of some of his old stuff.
