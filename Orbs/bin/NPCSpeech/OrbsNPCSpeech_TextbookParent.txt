My daughter is very interested in the universe. She always keeps up with all of the latest scientific breakthroughs.
She says that one day she wants to work for NASA, so she studies very hard to learn all that she can about the science behind space travel.
I canâ€™t wait for the day when she can suit up and go in a real rocket to outer space!
