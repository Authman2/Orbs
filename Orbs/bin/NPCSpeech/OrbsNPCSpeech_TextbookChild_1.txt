Hey there!
I was just learning about the different planets in our solar system. The only problem is that my textbook is very outdated...
It still lists Pluto as a planet!
I wish I had enough money to pay for the most recent edition, but they’re just so expensive!
*Sigh* I guess I’ll be stuck with old information for a while...
