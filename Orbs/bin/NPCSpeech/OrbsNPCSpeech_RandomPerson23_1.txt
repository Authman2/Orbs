Hello there, could you please do me a huge favor?
You see, today is my daughterâ€™s birthday and I forgot to pick up the cake.
If you could help me out and go pick up the cake for me I would really appreciate it!
All you have to do is go to the bakery in a town towards the east and hand them this receipt.
You received a(n) Bakery Receipt! 
They will give you the cake once you hand them the receipt.
Please hurry back! The party starts in a few hours!
