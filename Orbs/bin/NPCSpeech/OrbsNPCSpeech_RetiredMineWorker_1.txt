Hello there!
What's that? You're looking for some mining equipment?
Perfect! I was hoping to get rid of some of this old junk anyway.
Hmm... Let's see...
Ah! How about this pickaxe? It's perfect for chipping away at rocks.
How much does it cost? Don't even worry about that. You can have it   for free.
But be careful, that pickaxe is very old. We wouldn't want it to break now would we?
