Hi there! I sell all sorts of jars and containers.
Would you like to hear about our item of the day? It's a small, square container used to store potentially dangerous materials.
Nothing will slip out of this container! It can handle anything you   put into it, and it's perfect for any type of storage!
If you're interested, I can sell it to you for $40.
I'm sorry, it looks like you don't have enough money to purchase this product.
Come back when you have enough! I'll hold it for you until you return!
